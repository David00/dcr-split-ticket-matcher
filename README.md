# DCR Split Ticket Matcher Service

Software for decred holders to buy only a fraction of a ticket, enabling more individuals to participate in the decision making process. This is done in a (mostly) trustless way, such that the funds used do not leave the control of its owner.

Currently in [beta stage](/docs/beta.md).
