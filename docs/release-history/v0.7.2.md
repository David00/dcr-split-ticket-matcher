# Changelog for vesion 0.7.2

This is a service-only release.

This solves the issue of blocking waiting list notifications when a new session is started (this was shown as a warning in logs).

It also rate-limits waiting list change notifications to clients to at most once every five seconds and improves some log lines for better tracking possible misuses of the service.
