# Changelog for vesion 0.7.6

This changes the way utxo fetching is done when the `UtxosFromDcrdata` config option is enabled. This option is mostly used when using the buyer with a SPV wallet.

Previously, individual requests were done for each split input which is both inneficient and was causing problems with certain users.

This version changes the fetching process so that a single batched call to dcrdata is performed and the results are parsed and verified.
